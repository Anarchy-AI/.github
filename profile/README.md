## Mission

We're on a mission to democratize AI at whatever the cost. We're hackers who've grown tired of AI safety rhetoric meaning locked-down APIs with inconsistent support.

### Our promises
- We will move towards open-source, not away from it.
- We will work to accelerate the commoditization of AI.
- We will not judge your use-cases (provided it is legal).

### How will we make money?

We are working to provide managed model hosting and training infrastructure for both developers and enterprises.

## Projects

### [LLM-VM](https://github.com/Anarchy-AI/LLM-VM)

The LLM-VM is an LLM agnostic JIT for natural language.  Specifically, it uses LLMs to convert conversational natural language into a dynamic series of LLM and IO commands.
You provide the underlying provider(s), actions (APIs, code-hooks) and their descriptions, data-sources (PDFs, websites...), and the LLM-VM will take care of load-balancing, fine-tuning, natural language compilation and tool-selection.

### [chat.dev](https://chat.dev/)

This is our managed hosting service for the LLM-VM.  Here you can create an optimized LLM endpoint with access to your APIs and data.
