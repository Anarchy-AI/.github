## Mission

We're on a mission to democratize AI at whatever the cost. We're hackers who've grown tired of AI safety rhetoric meaning locked-down APIs with inconsistent support.

### How are we fixing this?
- Anarchy is starting by building the first provider-independent LLM-VM, and offering managed hosting to assist the transition away from single-point-of-failure providers.
Technically, what does this mean?
- The LLM-VM is a JIT that uses LLMs to convert conversational natural language into a dynamic series of LLM and IO commands.
- You provide the underlying provider(s), actions (APIs, code-hooks) and their descriptions, data-sources (PDFs, websites...), and the LLM-VM will take care of load-balancing, fine-tuning, natural language compilation and tool-selection.
- 
### Our promises
- We will move towards open-source, not away from it.
- We will work to accelerate the commoditization of AI.
- We will not judge your use-cases (provided it is legal).

### How will we make money?

We are working to provide managed model hosting and training infrastructure for both developers and enterprises.

## Projects

### LLM-VM
The LLM-VM is an LLM agnostic JIT for natural language.  Specifically, it uses LLMs to convert conversational natural language into a dynamic series of LLM and IO commands.
You provide the underlying provider(s), actions (APIs, code-hooks) and their descriptions, data-sources (PDFs, websites...), and the LLM-VM will take care of load-balancing, fine-tuning, natural language compilation and tool-selection.
